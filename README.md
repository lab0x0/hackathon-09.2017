### Project: Lab Zero Introductor. 

It's a wechat mini app, which is BLE beacon base. 

I proposed a introductor device base on BLE beacon. With wechat mini app, the visitors or the fresh members can know Lab Zero better.

3 people in this team for now, we are open to anyone who want to join us.

People: **Arron Xu(Leader)**, 杨城, Michael Xie

### Project: Duo

The goal of this project is to read the data from the electricity meter in SZDIY Hackspace and send the data to a server, so we can know how much energy we use every day. 

Now we have a server side with Django, web frontend interface, and a Raspberry Pi node(later to esp8266).

People: **Atommann(Leader)**, Kevin, Tony Wang, Terry Ouyang

### Project: A DIY Keyboard

I'm trying to make my own keyboard with my self-customized key map. I have designed the software and the hardware myself, and it's not yet finished.

Right now I want to write a key logger for it. The MCU is STM32.

People: **Rafael Li**, Matiss Zarins

### Project: Smart Air Refresher

I have this air refresher which can help refresh the air in the room when CO2 is too high. I have design a PCB with ESP8266 to replace the original one, enabling it's capability to connect to the server, so I can monitor it from a web site.

Need Django programmer for server side, and ESP8266 programmer with Arduino IDE.

People: **danfei**, 
 
### Project: Alexa Switch

4 channel light switch with voice control.

Need ESP8266 programmer, hardware guy.

People: **Alex**, Tejis Dupont, Janis Selis

# Attendants

## To add your own information, please ask one of the organizers to help you.

In the days up to the event, we asked people to introduce themselves. We are now posting the introductions here so everyone has an easier time finding the right project. It might be useful to use your browser's search to find keywords you're interested in.

Feel free to add your information using the following template:  
`— Who are you, how can we recognize you tonight, and what can you do?`  
`- How do you see your role in a team project during the hackathon (ex: software, designer, hardware)?`  
`— Would you rather join a team, or find members for your idea?`  
`— What kind of project ideas or areas of interest you would like to work on during the event?`  
`— Do you already have a team?`  
`- Which days will you be participating (Saturday, Sunday)?`  

## Responses

> 1. I'm Alex, LAB ZERO member
> 2. I'm can do software part, server side. Also can management and UI design a little.
> 3. I have own ideas, but also ok to join some team
> My ideas for projects:
> - access to internet from win95 80mhz laptop ising dialup modem. (Need setup dialup server on raspberry pi and some electronic to emulate telephone lines)
> - wechat small app for LZ door lock (also needed server side api)
> - Air conditioner automatic switching off when nobody in the lab (could use infrared or some wireless to transmit data)
> - Amazon echo voice controll for Lab zero light. (Will use ESP 8266)
> 4. I'm alone, no team
> 5. can participate all 3 days

Hi hackers!
I am Janis from Latvia. I do a bit of everything, but nothing exceptionally well :)
I have worked with arduinos quite a lot, including software and hardware - controlling and reading anything conductive. 
Software wise - i've done a bunch of classic web programming - front and back, also some object-oriented ones including C, C++, VB, python.
Hardware wise - the part that gives me most pleasure - mechanics, mechatronics, latches, levers, triggers and traps :)
Id love to learn more and fill the gaps, so I'll annoy you with lots of dumb questions.
